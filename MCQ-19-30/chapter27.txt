#
2. If each key is mapped to a different index in the hash table, it is called _______.
a. normal hashing
b. perfect hashing 
Key:b

#
3. A collision occurs _____________.
a. when two or more keys are mapped to the same hash value. 
b. when two elements have the same key value. 
c. when two elements are mapped to the same key.
Key:a
